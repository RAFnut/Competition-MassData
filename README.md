MentionWiz - Twitter Mass Data Analyzer
===========

This is the winning project from the second RAF Hackathon that we developed by Team Rafnut (Andrej Karadžić, Filip Danić, Nikola Klipa and Nikola Mastilović). In 24 hours we created a web application that can collect data from Twitter (based on keywords and location), analyze it based on the sentiment of the tweets and display it in a very intuitive way.  

Our technology stack included Symfony2, Python, JavaScript, Twig, jQuery and ChartJS. We also used a couple of interesting APIs, most notably the Twitter and Google Maps API.

The sentiment analysis was created by improving an existing open-source project that was made with Python. We expanded the dictionary and updated the grammar.
